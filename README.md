# (Course) Carsharing API with FastAPI

Simple Carsharing API with FastAPI. Code based on this [PluralSight Course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/fastapi-fundamentals), with my own variations and additions.

- Create a venv
- Install SQLModel: `pip3 install -r requirements.txtl`
- Use your IDE's run button or `uvicorn carsharing:app --reload`
- Check the API docs at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
